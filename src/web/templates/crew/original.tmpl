Although he was introduced to the indie gaming scene relatively recently, his belief that games can be art drives his interest in playing cool indie titles. He's also single and likes to cook ... ladies."

As a loyal crewman, he magnanimously accepts the blame when things go wrong, and is thus misperceived as a Cylon or a spy by his crewmates. Despite these accusations, he soldiers on, doing what he can to bring joy to the lives of sick children."

He spends most of his time extolling the virtues of playtesting to his students or brushing up on the latest methodologies. When he's not conducting video game science, Colin partakes in a number of other activities, such as cooking, skiing, and caring way too much about pro wrestling. He currently holds the record for most tables flipped at IGG."

In fact, he's won the award for longest playtime at IGG two years in a row, and has the skills to match... details that I wonder why he didn't think to mention in his own bro."
